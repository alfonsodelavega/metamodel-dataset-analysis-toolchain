# Repository Evaluation ToolChain
This project includes the toolchain we have used to automatically characterize a dataset of 2,418 metamodels made available for reuse. 

## Scope of the presented tool
Given a set of metamodels in input, the toolchain can generate a CSV file reporting several characteristics of the analyzed metamodels i.e.
possible well-formedness violations (and related severity) and the values of  quality metrics automatically measured on the input metamodels. Thus, 
users can make use of the produced CSV file to filter out those metamodels that satisfy the characteristics that are of interests for the experiments to be 
executed.
